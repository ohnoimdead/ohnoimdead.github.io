      <description>Personal sites are a complicated matter. How do you authentically project who you are into a 2d digital space? This site has gone through nearly as many iterations as I have in the time I&amp;rsquo;ve owned the domain. And that&amp;rsquo;s not counting all the other personal sites I&amp;rsquo;ve had over the years. A personal site is inherently something that changes as you change.
Also critically important is the way you interface with your personal site.</description>
