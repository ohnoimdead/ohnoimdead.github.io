      <description>Unity 2D Performance tl;dr Unity performance for 2D is terrible.
I spent some time prototyping a visually simple, top-down, 2D sprite-based game and noticed skipped frames. After poking through the profiler and discovering a crazy amount of time spent waiting to sync FPS, I turned off VSync, which fixed the frame drops and introduced significant screen tearing.
I spent some time trying to debug the poor performance assuming it was something I was doing wrong (lot&amp;rsquo;s of 2D games are made in Unity right?</description>

      <description>Or: One of the Many Ways Unity Screws New Programmers Let&amp;rsquo;s say you are fairly new to coding and you want to make a 2D game in Unity. You watch some tuts, you get excited, you come up with a concept, you make some art, you figure out how to create sprites, you make some game objects, you add behavior to those game objects, etc. Eventually you realize that part of your game needs to dynamically change the sprite displayed on an object based on a game event, like user interaction.</description>

      <description>Not quite ready to add this to the projects section yet but Silent Earth is a pen-and-paper role-playing game I&amp;rsquo;ve had on the back-burner for quite a while. After pitching it to a few folks recently it got re-prioritized and I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on it here-and-there for the past few weeks. It is now in a state ready for early playtesting.
The game is set in the far future right here on our home planet, where players are fighting to save human consciousness from a digital calamity.</description>

      <description>Personal sites are a complicated matter. How do you authentically project your personality into a 2d digital space? This site has gone through nearly as many iterations as I have, which is to say, a lot.
Every personal site has two experiences: the one the public interacts with, and the one you interact with when you manage the site&amp;rsquo;s content. If that interface feels like an I-have-to-sit-down-and-make-an-update type event, then you probably just won&amp;rsquo;t.</description>
