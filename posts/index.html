  <p>Personal sites are a complicated matter. How do you authentically project who you are into a 2d digital space? This site has gone through nearly as many iterations as I have in the time I&rsquo;ve owned the domain. And that&rsquo;s not counting all the other personal sites I&rsquo;ve had over the years. A personal site is inherently something that changes as you change.</p>

<p>Also critically important is the way you interface with your personal site. If updating content on your site is a pain, then you aren&rsquo;t going to do it. If the way you interact with your site is flagged as a I-have-to-sit-down-and-make-an-update type event in your brain, then even the thought of making an update is going to feel like work. How you interface with your site should be as personal as the site itself.</p>

<p>That is why most of my personal sites have been served from platforms I created. My very first personal web site (no you can&rsquo;t have the link) has a snapshot on the Internet Archive with a &ldquo;Microsoft OLE DB Provider for ODBC Drivers&rdquo; error. I completely forgot that my first personal site used Microsoft Access as a data store (my excuse is that I worked at Microsoft at the time). That was in 2001. The original version of that site launched in 1998, over 20 years ago. I was 24.</p>

<p>Fast forward to now. This site is authored with <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a> which is&hellip; fine. Hugo is an un-opinionated static site generator that is extremely feature rich, and a pain-in-the-ass to learn. I played around with various other platforms and choose Hugo for reasons that aren&rsquo;t interesting enough to go into, however, I picked something off-the-shelf because I didn&rsquo;t have the time to author what I really wanted.</p>

<p>There are a lot more choices now then there was 20 years ago though. Now that the crunch time of getting this site back up is over, I might take another look around for something that feels more like a home for me, and not just for the rest of you. And if I don&rsquo;t find something I like? Well, expect a new post in the <a href="/projects">Projects</a> section.</p>

<p>My point is: if you want to be successful with your personal site, pick (or make) a platform that <a href="https://konmari.com">sparks joy</a>.</p>

<p>As of this post, I&rsquo;m not quite there.</p>
