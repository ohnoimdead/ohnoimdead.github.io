<h1 id="unity-2d-performance">Unity 2D Performance</h1>

<p>tl;dr Unity performance for 2D is terrible.</p>

<p>I spent some time prototyping a visually simple, top-down,
2D sprite-based game and noticed skipped frames. After poking
through the profiler and discovering a crazy amount of time spent waiting to
sync FPS, I turned off VSync, which fixed the frame drops and introduced
significant screen tearing.</p>

<p>I spent some time trying to debug the poor performance assuming it was something
I was doing wrong (lot&rsquo;s of 2D games are made in Unity right?) and started
removing objects from a test scene, then running the profiler after each removal, trying and figure out which
objects were causing the problem.</p>

<p>Until all the objects were gone.</p>

<p>Wait, what?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m on a MacBook Pro, 2.9 GHz i7, Radeon Pro 560 w/ 4 GB and trying to render,
then move, a few sprites on the screen. This should NOT be a problem. So to
just verify that I wasn&rsquo;t loosing my mind I created a brand new Unity 2D project
(2019.3.0a2, the latest as of writing this), fired up the profiler, and clicked
play. The following screen shots show the results. Again, this is a brand
new project with absolutely nothing in it but a camera and whatever default crap
Unity throws into projects.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s right folks: a 127ms frame rendering absolutely nothing but a
background color.</p>

<p>My next thought was that maybe this is just the editor causing poor performance, because it is quite slow.
I added a single object with a sprite renderer, a simple 32x32 sprite, and
a very simple script to move the object on key presses. I built and ran the game.
There were visible frame skips (or tears if I turned off VSync) rendering and moving
a single sprite in an otherwise completely empty project.</p>

<p>As a final test, I moved over to my Windows Surface and ran
the same project. While it did run significantly better on the Windows machine, a
single moving sprite was unable to reliably achieve 60 fps.</p>

<p>I know. It sounds insane. I&rsquo;m guessing the studios producing 2D titles using Unity
have a lot of tricks up their sleeve to improve performance. But at some point
you have to ask: does the benefit outweigh the performance costs?</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s also worth noting that my VR game (also written in Unity) ran great
with &gt; 60 FPS rendering stereoscopic images simultaneously on an older Android mobile.</p>

<p>So I guess Unity is great for 3D, and pretty bad for 2D.</p>
